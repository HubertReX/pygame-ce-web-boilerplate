# Introduction

This is a template for a game using [Pygame-CE](https://pyga.me/) that can run on both desktop and browser.

## Features

* runs on the web browser (itch.io and GitHub Pages) thanks to [pygbag](https://pygame-web.github.io/)
* implemented finite state machine
* usage of menus [pygame-menu](https://github.com/ppizarror/pygame-menu) (patched - gfxdraw not working in WEB)
* partial mouse support (in menus)
* [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) map loading [pytmx](https://github.com/bitcraft/pytmx)
* map live reloading, scrolling, and zooming [pyscroll](https://github.com/bitcraft/pyscroll)
* transition between maps (Village, VillageHouse)
* map with layers (occlusion, collision, player start, exits)
* semi-transparent panels and text background (alpha blending)
* full-screen color filter (alpha blending, e.g.: warm sunny light, dark blue at night)
* particle system (falling leaves, more to come) - currently not working in WEB
* game auto pause (if the game window is out of focus)
* pixel style monospace font
* a custom mouse cursor
* animated sprites with shadows and different moving states (Idle, Walk, Run, Jump, Fly)
* characters follow individual lists of waypoints
* separation of key bindings from actions
* scene transitions (fade in/out, round shutter)
* automatic screenshots
* experimental use of OpenGL/WebGL shaders ([zengl](https://github.com/szabolcsdombi/zengl)) for postprocessing effects - for now, works only in the Web version

## Ideas for future

Features:

* ~~list key bindings~~ ‚úÖ
* create global config json with schema
* add UI (health bar, stats)
* ~~add particles system~~ ‚úÖ (~~leafs~~ ‚úÖ, ~~wind~~ ‚úÖ, rain, footsteps, smoke) - WIP ‚è≥üîÑ
* add day/night cycle and weather (rain)
* add fog of war and/or line of sight
* add light sources (camp fire, torch, houses)
* ~~add NPC, enemies and animals with movements (add shadows)~~ ‚úÖ
* add movable objects
* add object destruction
* add item drop/pickup and inventory system
* add fighting system
* add dialog system
* add merchants
* add cutscenes
* add game save/load system
* add game highscore table
* add game achievements
* add music and sfx
* add better menus
* add dungeons (generated procedurally)
* add path finding algorithm
* make more maps

Bugs:

* ~~screenshot of menu not working (showing only part of menu)~~ ‚úÖ
* ~~some key events are lost (action is repeated even key is not pressed in menus)~~ ‚úÖ
* continuing game after exiting menu causes loosing player's position on small map (works on grassland though)
* should new map be a new game state?

## Installation

```bash
# create venv
python3 -m venv .venv
# activate it
# on Linux/MacOS
source .venv/bin/activate
# on Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

Desktop mode:

```bash
cd project
python main.py
```

***

Browser mode:

```bash
# from top level folder
pygbag --ume_block 0 project
```

open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in browser

use [http://localhost:8000#debug](http://localhost:8000/debug) to show Python repl terminal in browser - useful for troubleshooting
