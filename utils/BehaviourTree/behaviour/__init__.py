src.npc.behaviour
The behaviour submodule of npc groups everything related to the behaviour of
AI-controlled Entities.

Aside from the parent class of all AI-controlled Entities, AIBehaviour, this
module contains the behaviour trees for all different types of Entities.

When running a custom behaviour tree, any state can be passed by creating a
sublass of ai_behaviour_tree_base.Context.
