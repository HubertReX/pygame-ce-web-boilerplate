**S**crollable **F**ormatted (and auto-wrapping) **Text** rendering for pygame

A simple pygame module to load big texts, wrap'em to fit the screen (or surface given), allow scrolling (with keyboard: up, down, pg_down, pg_up, home, end, and mouse wheel) and render it with some formatting (you can change alignment, font, bold, italic, underline, size, color - and thats all for now).

There are two examples (and a screenshot of each) on the ['example'](https://github.com/LukeMS/sftext/tree/master/example) folder.

Feedbacks on performance, improvements that could be done, bugs, anything, will be highly appreciated.
