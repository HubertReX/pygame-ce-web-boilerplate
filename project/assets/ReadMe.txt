HOMESPUN
A TrueType Font by S. John Ross

Here’s another cousin in the same friendly hand-drawn Roman family as Apple Butter and Atlas of the Magi. Like those, Homespun hails from hand-drawn masters created with a Sharpie laundry marker on ordinary notebook paper, then smoothed a bit to add warmth and remove the paper bleed. Homespun sits a little taller in the saddle than the earlier fonts, and comes in two versions: regular and small-caps. Homespun Small Caps is a genuine small-caps font, with proportionate line-weight between the uppercase and lowercase glyphs (which means the lowercase set looks a little chubby, but it was an experiment I learned from, so there’s that).

Both are full-keyboard fonts with a few extras thrown in.
