[h3][bold]Hi[/bold] :exclamation:[/h3]
Welcome to our [loc]Tavern[/loc]! I'm [char]Barman Bart[/char] :smile: .
I was practically [italic]born in this [loc]Tavern[/loc][/italic]. Actually,
my birthplace is in that table in the corner.






[char]My father[/char] is the owner of this [loc]Tavern[/loc], and I helped him
since I can remember. I know everybody in the area.



For the right price :blink: , I can [act]fix[/act] this and
that. And for my [b]friends[/b] I have preferential rates.

And you are  :red_question:.
